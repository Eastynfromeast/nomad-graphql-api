#3-1.Overfetching & Underfetching
    Problems GraphQL fixes === 2 very big problems REST api has
    1. Overfetching 
       getting much more data than we actually need

        In GraphQL, we ask for the data we need, not getting requested data immediately
        => Ask for what you need, get exactly that 

    2.Underfetching
        when we fetch the data less than we need 
        Then, we need to request much more times and some requests can be failed!
        
        ==> GraphQL APIs get all the data your app needs in a single request. === you don't have to send many requests with GraphQL
