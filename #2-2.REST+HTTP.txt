#2-2.REST+HTTP
    REST API is just an api using URLs
        What if we want to create a movie?
        nomadmovies.co/api/movies/create ? upload ? add ? 
        -> Adding verbs on your api is not a good practice
            it is not intuitive!
        => we need to rely on the HTTP protocols
        
        method + URL allows us can do much more than just with URLs
            GET /2/users/userId/bookmarks
                get the data of the user's bookmarks 
            POST /2/users/userId/bookmarks
                create an data of the user's new bookmark
            PUT /2/users/userId/bookmarks
                update the bookmark!
            DELETE /2/users/userId/bookmarks/:userId
                delete the bookmark
        
        REST api is easy to understand!
            most of the time, we are using GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
