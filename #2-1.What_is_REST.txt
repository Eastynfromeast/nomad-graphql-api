#2-1.What_is_REST
    Why we need a REST api or GraghQL api?
        to communicate with a backend

        Difference between REST api and GraghQL api?
            how to access the data on that API, how you communicate with the server
            just different buttons
        
        How to get data
            REST 
                ex. nomadmovies.co/api/movies
                    nomadmovies.co/api/movies/1
                    nomadmovies.co/api/search?rating=9
                => nomadmovies should expose the URL in public
                REST is organized and easy so ppl like it
                Everyone can call this API
                Things are very predictable since ppl use same conventions
